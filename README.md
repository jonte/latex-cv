![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jonte/latex-cv.svg?branch=master)

This is the latex document class I use for my CV, feel free to use however you'd like! I added an example cv, both the tex file and a rendered PDF. I use pdflatex, and all the packages used should be in texlive.

PDFs are produced from this project using travis-ci and are deployed to the [releases](https://github.com/jonte/latex-cv/releases) tab on GitHub - this is a good place to look for the latest rendering of the CV.
