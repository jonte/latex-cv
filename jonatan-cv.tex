\section*{Master's Thesis}
This thesis investigates the required properties and components of a low latency multimedia indexing system for automotive use. A survey of existing systems was made, and the Tracker indexing system was found to be most suitable. Tracker was then modified and improved to meet the automotive requirements set by Pelagicore, who also requested the thesis.

\section*{Bachelor's Thesis}
The thesis investigates whether it is possible to create a programming language agnostic application server specialized for game-like applications. The project was carried out by four team members and I learned many things about team work and organization, in addition to the actual technical aspects of the project. A prototype capable of powering several hundred simple game instances written in JavaScript was developed in Erlang.

\section*{Professional merits}
\subsection*{Thesis worker}
\emph{Pelagicore}\\
June 2013 -- Ongoing \newline\newline
I've worked with media indexing, process containment, BSP development, Qt development, and some HMI development. Peagicore develops embedded Linux systems for Automotive IVI systems, so I have done a lot of embedded Linux programming as well. I am also a member of two GENIVI expert groups; the Consumer Electronics \& Connectivity Expert Group and the Networking Expert Group. I have given talks at FOSDEM and am active in open source development.

\subsection*{Thesis worker}
\emph{Pelagicore}\\
January 2013 -- June 2013 \newline\newline
I wrote my Master's thesis in the Gothenburg office of Pelagicore, see Master's thesis section.

\subsubsection*{Software developer}
\emph{Mezmerize-e} \\
February 2011 -- February 2012\newline\newline
During my time here, I developed a product recommendation engine for e-commerce. The engine suggested products based on purchase patterns and product similarity. I worked with Python, PHP, memcached, Apache and MySQL.

\section*{Personal notes}
I love technology and software development. I have strong opinions on software and systems, because these things are important to me. I am an avid Linux user, and I really, really like UNIX-like systems. I enjoy working in open source communities, and I strongly empathize with open source ideas and ideals, software wants to be free :)

For me, my job needs to be challenging, and my colleagues need to be competent, which means we can learn from each other. Learning new things is very important, and I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest news in the projects I enjoy. I also enjoy teaching co-workers, or community members new things in order to build better projects.
